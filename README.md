# Protégé IGDTUW App

Protégé App is the official app of Protégé IGDTUW - The mentorship society of IGDTUW.

## Idea

During our first year in college, we often felt intimidated by our new surroundings, and found ourselves pondering upon questions like "Which programming language to learn?" "Which books to refer?" "How to not miss-out on opportunities?"
Protégé aims to answer all these questions and more by connecting students with their seniors who will mentor them in all aspects of college life. The app allows the students to connect with a mentor, access the resource center and stay updated with upcoming events.

## Features

- Resource Center
The app provides multiple resources for different domains. From developemnt to ML to scholarships, you'll find everything in the resource center.

- Chat with your mentor
Once assigned a mentor, you can use the app to chat with your mentor and receive the best guidance.

- Events
The app lists down upcoming events happening in and outside college. 

- Feedback/Help Center
The app has a help center where the user can send feedback, suggestions or complaints to Protege IGDTUW. 

- Profile
The user can view and edit their profile. Both mentors and mentees can view the profile of mentors and mentees they are paired with.

- Change theme
Ofcourse, Protégé App is available in both light and dark theme!
